App Usage: digital wellbeing 
This is short project to track my app usage and find some insights to modify my usage
Let’s begin by categorizing the apps in my phone. To maintain privacy, I have not included the names of the apps, but provided categories of apps I use.

Data collection:
Total apps: 121
Apps for 
1.	professional use:22
2.	 social:7
3.	Food:5
4.	Ecommerce/shopping:10
5.	Travel:3
6.	Built-in apps/background apps:57
7.	Hobby/entertainment:20
Tracking my app usage for 28 days: from july 24th to august 20th 2022.
Method: Instead of tracking the usage of apps via another app, monitored digital well-being under settings.
Analysis:
By the end to the 28 days, I observed the below difference:
	professional	idle-work+phone	hobby/entertainment	social	ecom	travel	food apps	total
average time spent	9.54	16.21	166.00	99.21	61.04	0.04	2.14	354.18
total apps used	2	0	3	3	2	0	2	12
total apps	22	57	20	7	10	3	5	121
%usage in app purpose	9.09%	0.00%	15.00%	42.86%	20.00%	0.00%	40.00%	9.92%
average time spent	2.69%	4.58%	46.87%	28.01%	17.23%	0.01%	0.61%

Over the duration, dashboard:

I could go on with every minute detail, I could find, but this summarizes my insights and my app usage for this duration.
Conclusion/insights:
My entertainment section constitute of almost half of the screen time, followed by social aps and then ecom. Apps. From the total apps on my phone I use only 9.9%, remaining which are untouched/running in the background, because “someday it might be useful”. 
This surely saves a lot of space now as I delete unused and unnecessary apps that take up much storage space.
